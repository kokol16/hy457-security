NOTES :

otp : The input being sanitized and special characters get excluded from the plaintext

Caesar's : The input being sanitized and special characters get excluded from the plaintext

playfair : We suppose tha input is upper case letters . if other than uppercase letters is inserted , an error message is thrown.

Affine cipher : The input being sanitized and special characters get excluded from the plaintext


feistel  cipher : all characters get encrypted

When you execute an algorithtm , ciphertext is stored on a file(e.g otp_encrypted) for future use if user want.

execute program , make run --> ./a.out <input file> (optional)
